# Challenge 7 - Building Models in Azure Machine Learning Notebooks

## Prerequisities

1. [Challenge 6 - Building Models in Azure Machine Learning AutoML](./06-AMLAutoML.md) should be done successfully.

## Introduction

# Much of this is TBD based on Anthony's work

Now that we have completed all the "Core" Challenges, we can extend the capabilities of your practice by introducing how to create/test/run code-first notebooks that will give you almost infinite options to model creation.

## Success Criteria
1.  A published BikeBuyer model endpoint hosted in Azure ML using Notebooks.
1.  Demonstrate usage of the API.
1.  Create a new dataflow in Power BI to leverage the published API.

## Basic Hackflow
1. Go to "https://ml.azure.com" to launch the new "Studio" experince 
1. Create a new Notebook
1. Test the Notebook
1. Deploy the Notebook to an Endpoint
1. Test the Notebook with Postman
1. Use inside a Power BI dataflow


## Hints

1.  Have a closer look at the columns in BikeBuyerTraining and Prospective Buyer.  What is different about these two tables?  Are there any differences that could be preventing you from using your model?

## Learning resources

## Hints
1.  If you don't want to write code to call the REST API, Postman is a great tool. (http://getpostman.com)
